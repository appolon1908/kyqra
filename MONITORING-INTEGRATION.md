# Monitoring integration — kyqra

This repository contributes source, dependency and ownership evidence to the 63-repository monitoring inventory. Its profile is `release-and-dependency`; it does not register a runtime service or enable deployment. Repository ID `1334764212` provides stable identity across renames.

Completion requires CI for the exact source commit, an approved source release, repository ownership and a dependency inventory. Source identity consists of the Git SHA and configuration digest. Container image, environment, tenant, service, telemetry, alert and runtime-recovery evidence apply to the separately registered deployable services in their owning repositories; they are not fabricated for this source-only record.

`service_ids` remains empty, `runtime_onboarding_allowed` is false, and activation is disabled. This record cannot certify runtime coverage. Middleware remains the cross-system operational write authority; Prometheus owns metrics, Loki logs, Tempo traces, Alertmanager routing, Backstage catalog discovery, Sentry errors and Wazuh security observations.

This is an archival lineage. New crawler API, deployment and runtime monitoring belong to `appolon1908-hue/kyqra-crawler`; retaining this source record does not create a second crawler runtime.
